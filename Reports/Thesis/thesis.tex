\begin{preface}
 
I start with expressing my gratitude towards Roel for giving me the opportunity to work on a truly interesting subject. I also appreciate that you were not just an invisible promoter, but a promoter who showed a true interest in the subject and curiosity for the results of the research. \\
I also know that I am a lucky student who fell with his "butt in the butter" as Ellie took the time and effort to proofread my thesis a couple of times. Together with Roel, you really provided me with a lot of support and made it possible to finish my thesis in a way I'm proud of. Thank you. \\
On a  more personal note, I want to thank the people who stood by my side. My parents who gave me the opportunities in life and also prepared me for those opportunities. My friends, the CW kneusjes, my kotgenoten, and of course Siemen, the guy who somehow still manages to stay around. I also want to thank my future wife, just to cover all bases. \\

\noindent Milan out.
