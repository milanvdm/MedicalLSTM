- Introduction
	


- Context: Depends on chosen problem (ex. Prediction of Disease Progression | Word Embedding | Extracting knowledge of EHR ) - DONE

	Problem: info out of EHR
	State of the art:
	
		Explain Disease codes
		DiseaseProgression
		Explain Danish paper, Matrix group America (recommender), Querying

- Background: write about machine learning, time series, neural networks, backpropagation, Word2vec, deepwalk - DONE
	

- General Word2Vec Approach

	Oplossing:

	Review current literature 
	=> Explain in general on how we are going to solve the problem

	Explain the method used
	Explain Tsne
	Explain generalization
	Exlpain Vantage Point Tree


- Implementation - 09/04

	TensorFlow
	DL4J
	OSIM

- Experiments

	Set up
	Chosen parameters
	What we are validating
	
		Part about Word2Vec experiments to Danish paper
		Part about DeepWalk experiments to complete dataset
		Part about Mapping disease codes -> amount of matching words

	Results

- Discussion

	Why does it work/not work


- Conclusion


- Future work - 07/04 and 08/04
